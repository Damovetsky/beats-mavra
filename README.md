# Beats App

Beats is a cross-platform mobile app built in Flutter that makes it easy for beatmakers to post their music and sell them to rappers. The app has a range of features that help users find, customize, and purchase the beats they need, including the ability to put up beats for sale in three different formats, customize beats with *cover art*, *tempo*, *genre*, and more, search for beats by genre with filters, buy beats using cash transactions, listen to beats with our built-in music player, and add beats to favorites. The app also includes additional features such as authorization, user profile customization, *light/dark* themes, *English/Russian* localization, and search with filters.
